							<br>

                             <h4>My Quick Story</h4>
							 <p>My background range from being a Growth and Product leader with 6+ years of startup growth experience designing and executing growth strategies.</p>
							 <p>My approach to growth focuses on acquisition, activation and retention with an emphasis on the experimental methods, processes, and discipline necessary to grow through user feedback and data. 
							<p>At the start of 2020, I decided that as the world was changing, so would I. I knew this change would have to involve a career where I would get to combine love for technology with building. I chose Flatiron School's Self-Paced Online Software Engineering because it was solely self-paced April 2021, and have recently graduated in July 2022. I have strong skills in project management, identifying and troubleshooting critical issues and team collaboration. My background in growth marketing, business development and start-up growth will be an asset to my next role. I'm open to relocation. </p>
							 <p><b>As a developer</b></p>
							  <p>I’m focused on readability and clean code. It’s great when I’ve put together a solution that works as fast as possible, 
								but it’s greater whenever thane stay that way, regardless of who’s 
								working on them so after that I’ll spent a good amount of time making sure the solution. 
								I understand to built quality products it takes a team so I’m focused on writing clean, consistent, and readable, and maintainable code so others can feel welcomed around my code.</p>
								<p><b>As a person</b></p>
								 <p>If you had to describe myself in one word, it would be resourceful. I’ll take a problem and break it into smaller bits and put together a solution. This has helped me sail past tough obstacles.</p>I’m curious by nature and I love learning. </p>
