                            <h3>Looking for my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/q2em2o9u793jtm1/John_Kyeremeh_Engineer%20Resume.pdf?dl=0" target="blank">CV?</a></h3>
							<br>

                             <h4>My Passion</h4>
							 <p>I'm passionate about using my cross-disciplinary experience in Software Engineering, Growth, and Product Growth to drive consistent impact and connect the dots.</p>
							 <h4>My Background</h4>
							 <p>After working for 7+ years in growth and product growth, I followed my passion into a career in software engineering. As someone that strives to understand how things work and how they could work even better, there is seldom a problem or puzzle I won't take on enthusiastically.
							   As a software engineer, with a growth background, I make use of my broad range of experience to help marry technical implementation with business goals across engineering, product, and marketing. <b>Currently open to relocation and remote work.</b></p></p>
							 
							 <p>First and foremost, I love writing code. Ever since writing my first program in HTML/CSS and manipulating it to produce a desired immediate output, I have been obsessed with the ways software engineering can be used to solve practical and real programs. What I love about the role of software engineering; it's a never-ending puzzle that allows for extreme creativity, deep intelligent thought, and requires continuous ongoing education. There is always something new to learn and I love that.
							 Writing code is just a medium that we use to solve problems and improve the world we inhabit. Engineering needs to be involved in the process of determining what problems we choose to solve and how we approach them. This is why I'm looking to work with a company that values software engineers working closely with Product. It is extremely important to me that the code I write serves a purpose and helps drive the goals of the organization. Involvement in roadmap planning, project prioritization/scope, and vision/strategy is a must-have for me on any engineering team I join.</p>
							 
							 <p><b>As a developer</b></p>
							  <p>Iâ€™m focused on readability and clean code. Itâ€™s great when Iâ€™ve put together a solution that works as fast as possible, 
								but itâ€™s greater whenever thane stay that way, regardless of whoâ€™s 
								working on them so after that Iâ€™ll spent a good amount of time making sure the solution. 
								I understand to built quality products it takes a team so Iâ€™m focused on writing clean, consistent, and readable, and maintainable code so others can feel welcomed around my code.</p>
								<p><b>As a person</b></p>
								 <p>If you had to describe myself in one word, it would be resourceful. Iâ€™ll take a problem and break it into smaller bits and put together a solution. This has helped me sail past tough obstacles.</p>Iâ€™m curious by nature and I love learning. </p>

								 <h4>Achievements</h4>
								 <p>500 Startups Batch 20 Alumni (Obie.ai - Acquired in July 2021 by Lessonly. Lessonly was later acquired in October 2021 by Seismic) & Alumni of Vidyard (YC Company - has over a 300M valuation & joined early - under 18 employees) ðŸš€</p>
