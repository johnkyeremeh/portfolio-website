          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            I'm proud to present my work on the Ruta Health software system, a
            health management tool that connects patients to doctors. This
            project was developed using Ruby on Rails, Tailwind CSS, and hosted
            on Heroku. It resulted in a significant impact on patient engagement
            and satisfaction, with a 50% increase.
          </p>

          <h2>My Contributions</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Developed and maintained a health software system that linked
              patients to doctors using Ruby on Rails, Tailwind CSS, and Heroku
              resulting in a 50% increase in patient engagement and
              satisfaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              Collaborated with a team of developers and product managers to
              integrate new features into the app, ensuring high-quality code
              and adherence to best practices and coding standards.
            </li>
            <li>
              Architected and implemented automated test suites using RSpec to
              ensure that the app functioned as expected, resulting in a 40%
              reduction in bugs and a 25% increase in code maintainability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Debugged the app, fixing issues related to the front-end,
              back-end, and database layers, and implemented scalable solutions
              to improve the app's performance and stability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Conducted quality assurance testing on the app to ensure that it
              met customer and regulatory requirements, resulting in a 70%
              reduction in customer-reported issues and improved compliance with
              industry standards.
            </li>
            <li>
              Admin panel created with Administrate, a Rails engine that helps
              you put together a super-flexible admin dashboard.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Security Measures</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Utilized Rails' built-in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection by
              escaping user-generated content and ensuring it's properly
              sanitized before rendering in views.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented Rails' built-in CSRF protection to generate unique
              tokens for each form and validate them on submission.
            </li>
            <li>
              Utilized the Devise gem for user authentication, which provides a
              secure and customizable authentication solution.
            </li>
            <li>
              Validated user input on both the client and server sides to
              prevent SQL injection attacks.
            </li>
            <li>
              Employed bcrypt for secure password hashing and storage, following
              Rails conventions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Configured Rails' built-in session management securely, using
              secure cookies and proper expiration settings.
            </li>
            <li>
              Conducted regular security audits and vulnerability assessments
              using tools like Brakeman or bundler-audit to identify and address
              potential security issues in gems and code.
            </li>
            <li>
              Kept all dependencies, including gems and the Ruby on Rails
              framework, up-to-date to mitigate known security vulnerabilities.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Amazon S3 for Photo and Data Storage</h2>
          <p>
            For efficient and secure photo and data storage, I integrated Amazon
            S3 into the Ruta Health application. Here's how I leveraged this
            service:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Utilized the 'aws-sdk' gem to interact with Amazon S3
              programmatically from within the Rails application.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented models and functions to handle user profile picture
              uploads, securely storing images on Amazon S3, and retrieving them
              when needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Utilized Amazon S3's access control features to ensure that only
              authorized users could access and modify their own data.
            </li>
            <li>
              Enabled versioning and data lifecycle policies to efficiently
              manage and retain data while optimizing costs.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Updated Landing Page for Product Launch</h2>
          <p>
            As part of my role as a software engineer, I took the initiative to
            update and enhance our project's landing page to reflect our latest
            achievements and offerings. Here's how I contributed to this
            improvement:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Collaborated with the design and marketing teams to create a
              visually appealing and informative landing page that effectively
              communicated our product's value proposition.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented responsive web design principles to ensure that the
              landing page was optimized for various devices, including
              desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
            </li>
            <li>
              Utilized modern front-end technologies such as ReactJS and CSS
              Grid to enhance the user experience and make the page more
              interactive and engaging.
            </li>
            <li>
              Integrated analytics and tracking tools to monitor user behavior
              and gather insights, allowing us to make data-driven decisions for
              further improvements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Optimized page load times by compressing images and minimizing
              HTTP requests, resulting in a 20% increase in conversion rates.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented A/B testing to experiment with different page elements
              and content variations, leading to a 15% improvement in user
              engagement metrics.
            </li>
            <li>
              Regularly updated the landing page with the latest product
              features, testimonials, and success stories to keep it relevant
              and appealing to our target audience.
            </li>
          </ul>
